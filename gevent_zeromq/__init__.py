"""gevent_zmq - gevent compatibility with zeromq.

Usage
-----

Instead of importing zmq directly, do so in the following manner:

..

    from gevent_zeromq import zmq


Any calls that would have blocked the current thread will now only block the
current green thread.

This compatibility is accomplished by ensuring the nonblocking flag is set
before any blocking operation and the ZeroMQ file descriptor is polled
internally to trigger needed events.

    compatibility as well.
